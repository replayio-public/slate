Getting started

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn build`

Running the tests locally without Replay

1. `yarn test:integration`

Running the tests locally with Replay

> Running locally (with Replay Firefox) is not advisable. Tests are flaky because it takes too long, and/or behaves differently.

1. `yarn test:integration -- --browser "Replay Firefox"`
